<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>How do constitutions affect the degree of independence courts and judges exercise? More specifically, do constitutional guarantees protect courts and judges against usurpations of their ju-dicial independence? Furthermore, under what conditions have political institutions been able to violate these constitutional guarantees? Conventional wisdom holds that constitutional arrange-ments are 
automatically enforced, denoting that formal institutions, such as written constitutions, can shape the way others behave (Carey, 2000).</p>


<p> Constitutional scholars in the 1990s equated con-stitutional provisions with institutions. While developed countries usually have 
stable constitutional frameworks and states ensure their enforcement, the same cannot be said of developing 
countries (e.g., Pozas-Loyo and RÃ­os-Figueroa 2010; de Vanssay and Spindler 1994). In developing countries, 
scholars suggest, these formal institutions are rarely adhered to and, instead, are often violated 
(Levitsky and Murillo 2009). 
Hence, the question arises, can some formal institutional conditions, i.e., constitutional provisions, ensure the protection
 of judicial independence in new democracies more effectively than other conditions?</p>
